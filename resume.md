Who ?
-----

I'm a software developer living near [Rennes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rennes), France.

I worked remotely between 2008 and 2014 as a full stack web developer at Fotonauts, a company founded by a group of ex-Apple engineers to create [fotopedia](http://www.fotopedia.com), a photo community website.

My current centers of interest are the [Go](http://golang.org/) language, the [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com) framework and home automation, therefore I started a new open source project called [Jeego](https://github.com/aymerick/jeego) with a [web app](https://github.com/aymerick/jeego-web) and [DIY devices](https://github.com/aymerick/jeego-devices).

I am also involved in non-profit organizations like [3ailes](http://www.3ailes.org), [Williams Bretagne](http://www.williams-bretagne.org) and [Planet Williams](http://www.planet-williams.org), which, as a side effect, gives me the opportunity to acquire experience with [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)... geek forever :)


Work Experience
---------------

*   **Fotonauts / Fotopedia** (remote)

    *June 2008 – September 2014*

    I started at Fotonauts by setting up servers with [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com) then [Chef](http://www.getchef.com). I then developed several features: photo upload, async job system, users newsfeed, reputation system, achievements system, notifications and newsletter system.

    Although I have mainly done backend stuff, I also acquired experience in frontend development: [CSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS), [SASS](http://sass-lang.com), [Javascript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [responsive design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design) (even for [emails](http://zurb.com/ink/)).

    The Fotonauts team was based in Paris. Most of the time I worked from home at Betton, but one day a week I did go to Paris to work with my amazing colleagues (and to drink some beers with them).


*   **NewLC** (Rennes)

    *December 2004 – May 2008*

    I met Fotonauts founders while working as a contractor for Apple.

    I implemented the [SyncML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SyncML) protocol in the [iSync](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISync) synchronisation tool that was shipped with MacOS X. The addition of the SyncML protocol into iSync permitted to add support for tens of new mobile devices for Mac users.

    During that mission, I was in direct contact with the development teams of several phone manufacturers like [Nokia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia), [Sony-Ericsson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_ericsson) and [Motorola](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola).

    I worked remotely and autonomously from Rennes, reporting to the Apple team located in Paris.


*   **Teleca YacCom** (Rennes)

    *April 2000 – November 2004*

    I worked four years in the telecom industry, mainly on protocols on the server side ([WAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Application_Protocol) , [MMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia_Messaging_Service), [EMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_Messaging_Service), etc.). I also developed on mobile phones (the old ones, not the smart recent ones).

    I was a contractor, based in Rennes, for clients like [Mitsubishi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trium), [Samsung](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung), [Alcatel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcatel) and Philips.

    During that period, I started to write my first open-source code as a side project: the [WBXML Library](https://github.com/aymerick/libwbxml-0.9.3), to parse and encode the [WBXML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WBXML) format used by several wireless protocols at that time.
