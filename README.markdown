My resumé

Generated with <https://github.com/mwhite/resume>.

Usage
-----

Simply run `make` to generate PDF and HTML versions of each .md file in the
directory.

In order to enable visually appealing display of contact information, the
Markdown is passed through a Python script that looks for contact details
beginning on the fourth line and moves them into a right-aligned, zero-height
box at the top of the document.  Lines with bullets (•) will be treated as
separate contact lines in the output.

By default, an image of your [Gravatar](http://www.gravatar.com) will be added
to the HTML resumé.  This feature can be disabled by setting the environment
variable `GRAVATAR_OPTION=--no-gravatar`.
